# C-Simple-Key-Logger

This is a C++ keylogger that will track keystrokes but not distinguish from capitalization. 

Made for educational purposes.

To run the program bring it into a folder with a LOG.txt file in the folder.
Then run it in a terminal with a complier like gcc.

To stop the program press escape or whatever key you assigned it.

I am not responsible for any mishaps.
